# Fee Discount Uplift Optimization

This project studies how to allocate fee discounts under a fixed budget by estimating
the causal uplift of discounts on future user trading behavior, rather than relying on
simple threshold-based rules.

## Problem
Many platforms grant fee discounts based on users' past trading volume.
This project evaluates whether such discounts generate real incremental impact
and explores improved allocation strategies.

## Status
- README created
- Project setup in progress
